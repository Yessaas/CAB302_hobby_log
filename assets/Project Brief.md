Project Overview: 

The team will deliver a Java application that will help users to track their DIY projects. 

 

Goals/Objectives: 

Users need to be able to create plans with instructions.  

Users need to track the costs of materials.  

Users need to be able to log their progress and share it with other users.  

The application must support video/photo file hosting.  

 

Constraints/Assumptions: 

There are multiple constraints and limits to completing this project. The first is the time limit to complete the project by October 25. The second is the personal schedule of members, limiting the ability to contribute to the project whilst studying 3 other subjects and working. The third is the knowledge and skill limitation to implement specific goals. The main assumption is the difficulty in implementing multimedia embedding and access. The fourth is the assumption that committing different git branches may cause issues when implementing features. This in turn may affect the proposed timeline and completion of the project.  

 

 

 

Project Timeline: 

Checkpoint 1 -  Week 5 

Team Formation 

Project Requirements:  

Project Repository: 

Java Readiness Quiz 

Checkpoint 2 - Week 7 

User Stories:  20 users stories for the project  

Project Management Tool: adopted a PM tool and is using it to manage the project  

Release and First Sprint Plan: the team has completed a first sprint plan  

UI Design (Low/Medium Fidelity): The team has created a design for the Graphical User Interface 

Checkpoint 3 - Week 9 

Functional Prototype: The project has a functional user interface and stores data to a DB for persistence  

Test-Driven Development: the project includes a suitable test suite 

Version Control Workflow: There is evidence of regular commits to repositories and proper source management practices (e.g. branching) 

Checkpoint 4 - Week 11 

Enhanced Prototype: Most Features have now been implemented as they were detailed in 'Must Have' user stories 

Build Script: Build and Tests are automated using a build script in Github 

Automated Build Server: Github 'Actions' are in place to automated the CI/CD process 

 

Target Audience/Stakeholders: 

This application is designed to aid hobbyists and DIY enthusiasts in their process of completing projects. Broader stakeholders include Craft stores, DIY communities and educational platforms. This can be interpreted that craft stores would track materials purchased, DIY communities interact with updates from users and educational platforms source videos from users. 

 

Minimal Requirements: 

A graphical user interface with windows for the main functionalities, in general based on JavaFX 

An authentication system to sign-up/sign-in (GUI and models) 

A persistency system to store/retrieve/update user data (GUI and models) 

One or (more likely) more application windows in which the actual, useful part of the application is performed (again, with GUI and models)
